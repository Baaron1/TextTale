# TextTale
HOW TO RUN:

Open the "Start Game.exe" File to run the game


If you don't already have Python 3 installed please download it or press the "Python" button in out gui to download it automatically
when downloading Python with this method it is common to get a ERROR message the first time you try simply do it again and it should work fine



Please ignore the "Start Game" folder it just contains files required. Only use "Start Game.exe"



Undertale AU but it is just text
Please do not judge us too harshly this is our first time developing something like this so just chill it.
Have Fun!
